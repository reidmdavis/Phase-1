This is the ReadME file for phase 1 of my registration simulator.
All of the variables are named and initialized first so that they are easier to track later in the program, 
  as the program has six functions including the MAIN.

The first function is the instructions function and will print all of the neccessary instructions to the user's screen.
The second function (print) creates the template for the formatting of the final output.
Third function (FirstPage) collects from the user all of the pertinent data to be displayed on the first page, any overflow or overlapping 
  data is stored to be used later if needed.
The fourth and fifth functions behave similarly to the FirstPage funciton but they are collecting data for the second 
  and third pages respectfully.
C-IN is the most used tool for gathering data from the user and then the data is printed using C-OUT and formatted to fit the user's screen.
Then the main function controls the calling of the other functions to simplify the code and keep the main function as clean as possible.
